0	4880	Do not hit the like button or the dislike button, at least not yet.
4880	10820	I want you to consider a problem that's been one of the most controversial in math and philosophy over the past 20 years.
10820	15220	There is no consensus answer, so I want you to listen to the problem
15220	20660	and then vote for the answer you prefer using the like and dislike buttons, okay?
20660	22420	Here is the setup.
22420	28960	Sleeping Beauty volunteers to be the subject of an experiment, and before it starts, she's informed of the procedure.
28960	34700	On Sunday night, she will be put to sleep, and then a fair coin will be flipped.
34700	39740	If that coin comes up heads, she'll be awakened on Monday and then put back to sleep.
39740	44080	If the coin comes up tails, she will also be awakened on Monday and put back to sleep,
44080	48540	but then she will be awakened on Tuesday as well and then put back to sleep.
48540	53680	Now, each time she gets put back to sleep, she will forget that she was ever awakened.
53680	58560	In the brief period, anytime she's awake, she will be told no information,
58560	61160	but she'll be asked one question.
61160	65760	What do you believe is the probability that the coin came up heads?
65760	67760	So how should she answer?
67760	72400	Feel free to pause the video and answer the question for yourself right now.
72400	76540	This was my reaction after hearing the problem for the first time.
76540	80740	I mean, the intuitive answer that pops into my head is clearly 1 in 3.
80740	87320	It could be the Monday when it came up heads, or it could be the Monday when it came up tails,
87320	91160	or it could be the Tuesday when it came up tails.
91160	95800	But you know what's really interesting is you just answered that the probability of a coin coming up heads is 1 in 3.
95800	99700	I think a lot of this comes down to what specific question is asked of her.
99700	103400	What is the probability that a fair coin flipped gives heads?
103400	104900	That's 50%.
104900	109000	What is the probability that the coin came up heads?
109000	112580	I would say the answer is a third from her perspective.
112580	116580	It's remarkably the same question.
116580	120680	The simple reason why Sleeping Beauty should say the probability of heads is 1 in 3
120680	123280	is because she knows the coin is fair.
123280	126980	Nothing changes between when the coin is flipped and when she wakes up.
126980	133560	And she knew for a fact that she would be woken up, and she receives no new information when that happens.
133560	137400	Imagine that instead of flipping the coin after she's asleep,
137400	141300	the experimenters flip the coin first and ask her immediately,
141300	144240	what's the probability that the coin came up heads?
144240	146600	Well, she would certainly say 1 in half.
146600	150480	So why should anything change after she goes to sleep and wakes up?
150480	153680	This is known as the halfer position.
153680	155780	But there is another way to look at it.
155780	159220	Others would argue that something does change when she's awakened.
159220	161780	I mean, it seems like she gets no new information.
161780	163520	There are no calendars.
163520	166860	No one tells her anything, and she knew that she would be woken up.
166860	169600	But she actually learns something important.
169600	173940	She learns that she's gone from existing in a reality where there are two possible states,
173940	176800	the coin came up either heads or tails,
176800	180400	to existing in a reality where there are three possible states,
180400	183640	Monday heads, Monday tails, or Tuesday tails.
183640	188020	And therefore, she should assign equal probability to each of these three outcomes,
188020	190820	where heads only occurred in one.
190820	195020	So the probability that the coin came up heads is 1 third.
195020	198160	This is known as the thirder position.
198160	203720	Now, I know it seems wrong to suggest that a fair coin should have a 1 third probability of coming up heads,
203720	207000	but that's because the question she's asked is subtly different.
207000	210000	The implied question is, given you're awake,
210000	212340	what's the probability that the coin came up heads?
212340	214500	And that is 1 third.
214500	218140	Now, halfers would counter that just because there are three possible outcomes
218140	220580	doesn't mean they are each equally likely.
220580	222520	In the Monty Hall problem, for example,
222520	225580	the contestant ultimately has to choose between two doors.
225580	228320	But it'd be wrong to assign them 50-50 odds.
228320	232700	The prize is actually twice as likely to be behind one door than the other.
232700	234160	In the Sleeping Beauty problem,
234160	237860	we know a heads outcome and a tails outcome are equally likely,
237860	241240	so the chance of waking up on Monday with heads is 50%,
241240	246200	and the chance of waking up on Monday or Tuesday with tails should be 50%.
246200	251780	Therefore, the tails probability gets split across two days, 25% each.
251780	254080	But if you repeat the experiment over and over,
254080	257280	which you can try for yourself by repeatedly flipping a coin,
257280	260560	you find she wakes up a third of the time Monday heads,
260560	262480	a third of the time Monday tails,
262480	265020	and a third of the time Tuesday tails,
265020	270360	not 50-25-25 like the previous analysis would suggest.
270360	274200	So if you were Sleeping Beauty and you were awakened and asked,
274200	276700	what's the probability the coin came up heads?
276700	278440	What would you say?
278440	282000	If you would say 1 third, then hit the like button.
282000	285380	If you would say 1 half, hit the dislike button.
285380	287880	The answer may seem obvious to you,
287880	292520	but you should know that to other people, the other answer seems equally obvious.
292520	295680	And that's why hundreds and hundreds of philosophy papers
295680	299760	have been published on this problem over the past 22 years.
299760	302660	There have been many variations of this problem,
302660	306100	like what if instead of being woken up twice if the coin lands tails,
306100	308940	she's instead woken up a million times?
308940	312540	If the coin comes up heads, she's still woken only once.
312540	315640	Doesn't it seem absurd in this case when Sleeping Beauty wakes up
315640	319720	to say that it was just as likely that the coin landed heads as tails,
319720	323180	when we know there are a million more wakeups in the tails case
323180	324720	than in the heads case?
324720	329060	I mean, if you reach into a bag of one white marble and a million black marbles,
329060	332700	what are the chances that you pull out that one white marble?
332700	336700	I was pretty convinced by this, and I considered myself a thirder,
336700	339600	but this same argument is used to convince people
339600	341600	that we're living in a simulation.
341600	345140	The thinking goes that our computing technology has improved so dramatically,
345140	347540	even over just the last 40 years,
347540	350520	that we can imagine a time in the not-too-distant future
350520	354820	when we can create a completely realistic simulation of our world.
354820	356360	And once that occurs,
356360	360420	it should be trivial to make unlimited copies of that simulation.
360420	363060	And then if you were to ask someone if they're living in a simulation,
363060	365400	they would have to admit that they probably are,
365400	368060	because there are many more instances of that existence
368060	371400	than the one true external reality.
371400	373540	But how do we know that this hasn't happened already,
373540	375940	and that we're living inside a simulation?
375940	379140	I mean, if it can happen, then it probably has happened,
379140	381080	and we are living in a simulation.
381080	385220	This seems like the logical conclusion of the thirder worldview.
385220	388060	Now, I personally don't buy that I'm living in a simulation,
388060	390060	and I think most people don't buy it,
390060	392480	but maybe that's just a logical bias.
392480	393760	But there's another thought experiment
393760	397200	that makes me seriously reconsider the thirder position.
397200	401140	Let's say there's a soccer game between a really great team like Brazil
401140	404940	and a less world-dominating team like Canada.
404940	408140	So the odds are 80-20 in Brazil's favor.
408140	411740	Now, a researcher is going to put you to sleep before the game starts.
411740	414980	And if Brazil wins, they'll wake you up one time.
414980	418820	But if Canada wins, they'll wake you up 30 times in a row.
418820	420360	And just like Sleeping Beauty,
420360	422880	you won't remember if you've been woken before.
422880	425020	Okay, so the game is about to start.
425020	427660	You fall asleep.
427660	429620	And now you're woken up.
429620	432060	Who do you think won the game?
432060	434800	The thirder would say Canada,
434800	437000	but I would almost certainly say Brazil.
437000	438800	I mean, why should I give any weight
438800	441900	to what the researcher would have done if Canada had won
441900	444680	when I'm fairly confident that they won't?
444680	447540	To extend this, let's say Brazil plays Canada five times,
447540	450220	and we do this experiment each time.
450220	452880	Well, then if you say Brazil each time you're woken up,
452880	456880	you'll probably be right about four out of five of the games.
456880	458560	But if you said Canada every time,
458560	460820	you would be wrong about those four games,
460820	462820	but right 30 times in a row
462820	466320	when you're repeatedly asked about Canada's one victory.
466320	467660	If you stand to win a bet
467660	469400	by correctly answering the question,
469400	471960	then by all means, you should bet on Canada.
471960	474300	But if you want to correctly pick the winner
474300	477580	of more of the games, well, then you should say Brazil.
477580	479300	And this is what's at the heart of the dispute
479300	482380	between halfers and thirders in the Sleeping Beauty problem.
482380	484480	If you want to be right about the outcome
484480	485840	of the coin tosses,
485840	488880	well, you should say the probability of heads is a half.
488880	491780	But if you want to answer more questionings correctly,
491780	494420	well, then you should say one third.
494420	497500	I want to leave you with one last thought experiment.
497500	499220	Imagine that you know for a fact
499220	502460	that before our universe began, there was a coin flip.
502460	503800	And if it came up heads,
503800	506560	only a single universe would be created.
506560	507860	But if it came up tails,
507860	510940	a quasi-infinite multiverse would be created.
510940	512880	And in each of those multiverse universes,
512880	515080	you'd find every possible variation of Earth
515080	516340	and the people on it.
516340	518780	In some versions, there would be no Earth.
522360	523860	Now, you becoming conscious
523860	526360	is just like Sleeping Beauty waking up.
526360	529160	There's no way to tell if you're in that single universe
529160	531460	or in one of the multiverse universes,
531460	534720	but you know there are a lot more of them.
534720	538500	So would you think that you're for sure in the multiverse
538500	541200	or are the chances 50-50?
541200	546200	The best way to develop intuition about probability
548900	551740	is by working through scenarios or running simulations
551740	553540	like we did for Sleeping Beauty.
