00:00.000 --> 00:04.880
Do not hit the like button or the dislike button, at least not yet.

00:04.880 --> 00:10.820
I want you to consider a problem that's been one of the most controversial in math and philosophy over the past 20 years.

00:10.820 --> 00:15.220
There is no consensus answer, so I want you to listen to the problem

00:15.220 --> 00:20.660
and then vote for the answer you prefer using the like and dislike buttons, okay?

00:20.660 --> 00:22.420
Here is the setup.

00:22.420 --> 00:28.960
Sleeping Beauty volunteers to be the subject of an experiment, and before it starts, she's informed of the procedure.

00:28.960 --> 00:34.700
On Sunday night, she will be put to sleep, and then a fair coin will be flipped.

00:34.700 --> 00:39.740
If that coin comes up heads, she'll be awakened on Monday and then put back to sleep.

00:39.740 --> 00:44.080
If the coin comes up tails, she will also be awakened on Monday and put back to sleep,

00:44.080 --> 00:48.540
but then she will be awakened on Tuesday as well and then put back to sleep.

00:48.540 --> 00:53.680
Now, each time she gets put back to sleep, she will forget that she was ever awakened.

00:53.680 --> 00:58.560
In the brief period, anytime she's awake, she will be told no information,

00:58.560 --> 01:01.160
but she'll be asked one question.

01:01.160 --> 01:05.760
What do you believe is the probability that the coin came up heads?

01:05.760 --> 01:07.760
So how should she answer?

01:07.760 --> 01:12.400
Feel free to pause the video and answer the question for yourself right now.

01:12.400 --> 01:16.540
This was my reaction after hearing the problem for the first time.

01:16.540 --> 01:20.740
I mean, the intuitive answer that pops into my head is clearly 1 in 3.

01:20.740 --> 01:27.320
It could be the Monday when it came up heads, or it could be the Monday when it came up tails,

01:27.320 --> 01:31.160
or it could be the Tuesday when it came up tails.

01:31.160 --> 01:35.800
But you know what's really interesting is you just answered that the probability of a coin coming up heads is 1 in 3.

01:35.800 --> 01:39.700
I think a lot of this comes down to what specific question is asked of her.

01:39.700 --> 01:43.400
What is the probability that a fair coin flipped gives heads?

01:43.400 --> 01:44.900
That's 50%.

01:44.900 --> 01:49.000
What is the probability that the coin came up heads?

01:49.000 --> 01:52.580
I would say the answer is a third from her perspective.

01:52.580 --> 01:56.580
It's remarkably the same question.

01:56.580 --> 02:00.680
The simple reason why Sleeping Beauty should say the probability of heads is 1 in 3

02:00.680 --> 02:03.280
is because she knows the coin is fair.

02:03.280 --> 02:06.980
Nothing changes between when the coin is flipped and when she wakes up.

02:06.980 --> 02:13.560
And she knew for a fact that she would be woken up, and she receives no new information when that happens.

02:13.560 --> 02:17.400
Imagine that instead of flipping the coin after she's asleep,

02:17.400 --> 02:21.300
the experimenters flip the coin first and ask her immediately,

02:21.300 --> 02:24.240
what's the probability that the coin came up heads?

02:24.240 --> 02:26.600
Well, she would certainly say 1 in half.

02:26.600 --> 02:30.480
So why should anything change after she goes to sleep and wakes up?

02:30.480 --> 02:33.680
This is known as the halfer position.

02:33.680 --> 02:35.780
But there is another way to look at it.

02:35.780 --> 02:39.220
Others would argue that something does change when she's awakened.

02:39.220 --> 02:41.780
I mean, it seems like she gets no new information.

02:41.780 --> 02:43.520
There are no calendars.

02:43.520 --> 02:46.860
No one tells her anything, and she knew that she would be woken up.

02:46.860 --> 02:49.600
But she actually learns something important.

02:49.600 --> 02:53.940
She learns that she's gone from existing in a reality where there are two possible states,

02:53.940 --> 02:56.800
the coin came up either heads or tails,

02:56.800 --> 03:00.400
to existing in a reality where there are three possible states,

03:00.400 --> 03:03.640
Monday heads, Monday tails, or Tuesday tails.

03:03.640 --> 03:08.020
And therefore, she should assign equal probability to each of these three outcomes,

03:08.020 --> 03:10.820
where heads only occurred in one.

03:10.820 --> 03:15.020
So the probability that the coin came up heads is 1 third.

03:15.020 --> 03:18.160
This is known as the thirder position.

03:18.160 --> 03:23.720
Now, I know it seems wrong to suggest that a fair coin should have a 1 third probability of coming up heads,

03:23.720 --> 03:27.000
but that's because the question she's asked is subtly different.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
The implied question is, given you're awake,

03:30.000 --> 03:32.340
what's the probability that the coin came up heads?

03:32.340 --> 03:34.500
And that is 1 third.

03:34.500 --> 03:38.140
Now, halfers would counter that just because there are three possible outcomes

03:38.140 --> 03:40.580
doesn't mean they are each equally likely.

03:40.580 --> 03:42.520
In the Monty Hall problem, for example,

03:42.520 --> 03:45.580
the contestant ultimately has to choose between two doors.

03:45.580 --> 03:48.320
But it'd be wrong to assign them 50-50 odds.

03:48.320 --> 03:52.700
The prize is actually twice as likely to be behind one door than the other.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.160
In the Sleeping Beauty problem,

03:54.160 --> 03:57.860
we know a heads outcome and a tails outcome are equally likely,

03:57.860 --> 04:01.240
so the chance of waking up on Monday with heads is 50%,

04:01.240 --> 04:06.200
and the chance of waking up on Monday or Tuesday with tails should be 50%.

04:06.200 --> 04:11.780
Therefore, the tails probability gets split across two days, 25% each.

04:11.780 --> 04:14.080
But if you repeat the experiment over and over,

04:14.080 --> 04:17.280
which you can try for yourself by repeatedly flipping a coin,

04:17.280 --> 04:20.560
you find she wakes up a third of the time Monday heads,

04:20.560 --> 04:22.480
a third of the time Monday tails,

04:22.480 --> 04:25.020
and a third of the time Tuesday tails,

04:25.020 --> 04:30.360
not 50-25-25 like the previous analysis would suggest.

04:30.360 --> 04:34.200
So if you were Sleeping Beauty and you were awakened and asked,

04:34.200 --> 04:36.700
what's the probability the coin came up heads?

04:36.700 --> 04:38.440
What would you say?

04:38.440 --> 04:42.000
If you would say 1 third, then hit the like button.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.380
If you would say 1 half, hit the dislike button.

04:45.380 --> 04:47.880
The answer may seem obvious to you,

04:47.880 --> 04:52.520
but you should know that to other people, the other answer seems equally obvious.

04:52.520 --> 04:55.680
And that's why hundreds and hundreds of philosophy papers

04:55.680 --> 04:59.760
have been published on this problem over the past 22 years.

04:59.760 --> 05:02.660
There have been many variations of this problem,

05:02.660 --> 05:06.100
like what if instead of being woken up twice if the coin lands tails,

05:06.100 --> 05:08.940
she's instead woken up a million times?

05:08.940 --> 05:12.540
If the coin comes up heads, she's still woken only once.

05:12.540 --> 05:15.640
Doesn't it seem absurd in this case when Sleeping Beauty wakes up

05:15.640 --> 05:19.720
to say that it was just as likely that the coin landed heads as tails,

05:19.720 --> 05:23.180
when we know there are a million more wakeups in the tails case

05:23.180 --> 05:24.720
than in the heads case?

05:24.720 --> 05:29.060
I mean, if you reach into a bag of one white marble and a million black marbles,

05:29.060 --> 05:32.700
what are the chances that you pull out that one white marble?

05:32.700 --> 05:36.700
I was pretty convinced by this, and I considered myself a thirder,

05:36.700 --> 05:39.600
but this same argument is used to convince people

05:39.600 --> 05:41.600
that we're living in a simulation.

05:41.600 --> 05:45.140
The thinking goes that our computing technology has improved so dramatically,

05:45.140 --> 05:47.540
even over just the last 40 years,

05:47.540 --> 05:50.520
that we can imagine a time in the not-too-distant future

05:50.520 --> 05:54.820
when we can create a completely realistic simulation of our world.

05:54.820 --> 05:56.360
And once that occurs,

05:56.360 --> 06:00.420
it should be trivial to make unlimited copies of that simulation.

06:00.420 --> 06:03.060
And then if you were to ask someone if they're living in a simulation,

06:03.060 --> 06:05.400
they would have to admit that they probably are,

06:05.400 --> 06:08.060
because there are many more instances of that existence

06:08.060 --> 06:11.400
than the one true external reality.

06:11.400 --> 06:13.540
But how do we know that this hasn't happened already,

06:13.540 --> 06:15.940
and that we're living inside a simulation?

06:15.940 --> 06:19.140
I mean, if it can happen, then it probably has happened,

06:19.140 --> 06:21.080
and we are living in a simulation.

06:21.080 --> 06:25.220
This seems like the logical conclusion of the thirder worldview.

06:25.220 --> 06:28.060
Now, I personally don't buy that I'm living in a simulation,

06:28.060 --> 06:30.060
and I think most people don't buy it,

06:30.060 --> 06:32.480
but maybe that's just a logical bias.

06:32.480 --> 06:33.760
But there's another thought experiment

06:33.760 --> 06:37.200
that makes me seriously reconsider the thirder position.

06:37.200 --> 06:41.140
Let's say there's a soccer game between a really great team like Brazil

06:41.140 --> 06:44.940
and a less world-dominating team like Canada.

06:44.940 --> 06:48.140
So the odds are 80-20 in Brazil's favor.

06:48.140 --> 06:51.740
Now, a researcher is going to put you to sleep before the game starts.

06:51.740 --> 06:54.980
And if Brazil wins, they'll wake you up one time.

06:54.980 --> 06:58.820
But if Canada wins, they'll wake you up 30 times in a row.

06:58.820 --> 07:00.360
And just like Sleeping Beauty,

07:00.360 --> 07:02.880
you won't remember if you've been woken before.

07:02.880 --> 07:05.020
Okay, so the game is about to start.

07:05.020 --> 07:07.660
You fall asleep.

07:07.660 --> 07:09.620
And now you're woken up.

07:09.620 --> 07:12.060
Who do you think won the game?

07:12.060 --> 07:14.800
The thirder would say Canada,

07:14.800 --> 07:17.000
but I would almost certainly say Brazil.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.800
I mean, why should I give any weight

07:18.800 --> 07:21.900
to what the researcher would have done if Canada had won

07:21.900 --> 07:24.680
when I'm fairly confident that they won't?

07:24.680 --> 07:27.540
To extend this, let's say Brazil plays Canada five times,

07:27.540 --> 07:30.220
and we do this experiment each time.

07:30.220 --> 07:32.880
Well, then if you say Brazil each time you're woken up,

07:32.880 --> 07:36.880
you'll probably be right about four out of five of the games.

07:36.880 --> 07:38.560
But if you said Canada every time,

07:38.560 --> 07:40.820
you would be wrong about those four games,

07:40.820 --> 07:42.820
but right 30 times in a row

07:42.820 --> 07:46.320
when you're repeatedly asked about Canada's one victory.

07:46.320 --> 07:47.660
If you stand to win a bet

07:47.660 --> 07:49.400
by correctly answering the question,

07:49.400 --> 07:51.960
then by all means, you should bet on Canada.

07:51.960 --> 07:54.300
But if you want to correctly pick the winner

07:54.300 --> 07:57.580
of more of the games, well, then you should say Brazil.

07:57.580 --> 07:59.300
And this is what's at the heart of the dispute

07:59.300 --> 08:02.380
between halfers and thirders in the Sleeping Beauty problem.

08:02.380 --> 08:04.480
If you want to be right about the outcome

08:04.480 --> 08:05.840
of the coin tosses,

08:05.840 --> 08:08.880
well, you should say the probability of heads is a half.

08:08.880 --> 08:11.780
But if you want to answer more questionings correctly,

08:11.780 --> 08:14.420
well, then you should say one third.

08:14.420 --> 08:17.500
I want to leave you with one last thought experiment.

08:17.500 --> 08:19.220
Imagine that you know for a fact

08:19.220 --> 08:22.460
that before our universe began, there was a coin flip.

08:22.460 --> 08:23.800
And if it came up heads,

08:23.800 --> 08:26.560
only a single universe would be created.

08:26.560 --> 08:27.860
But if it came up tails,

08:27.860 --> 08:30.940
a quasi-infinite multiverse would be created.

08:30.940 --> 08:32.880
And in each of those multiverse universes,

08:32.880 --> 08:35.080
you'd find every possible variation of Earth

08:35.080 --> 08:36.340
and the people on it.

08:36.340 --> 08:38.780
In some versions, there would be no Earth.

08:42.360 --> 08:43.860
Now, you becoming conscious

08:43.860 --> 08:46.360
is just like Sleeping Beauty waking up.

08:46.360 --> 08:49.160
There's no way to tell if you're in that single universe

08:49.160 --> 08:51.460
or in one of the multiverse universes,

08:51.460 --> 08:54.720
but you know there are a lot more of them.

08:54.720 --> 08:58.500
So would you think that you're for sure in the multiverse

08:58.500 --> 09:01.200
or are the chances 50-50?

09:01.200 --> 09:06.200
The best way to develop intuition about probability

09:08.900 --> 09:11.740
is by working through scenarios or running simulations

09:11.740 --> 09:13.540
like we did for Sleeping Beauty.

09:45.500 --> 09:48.940
technology that's transforming our world right now.

09:48.940 --> 09:51.180
Are we actually living in a computer simulation

09:51.180 --> 09:52.740
or a multiverse?

09:52.740 --> 09:53.680
Who knows?
