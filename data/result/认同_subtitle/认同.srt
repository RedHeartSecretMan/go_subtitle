1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
Do not hit the like button or the dislike button, at least not yet.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:10,820
I want you to consider a problem that's been one of the most controversial in math and philosophy over the past 20 years.

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:15,220
There is no consensus answer, so I want you to listen to the problem

4
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:20,660
and then vote for the answer you prefer using the like and dislike buttons, okay?

5
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,420
Here is the setup.

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:28,960
Sleeping Beauty volunteers to be the subject of an experiment, and before it starts, she's informed of the procedure.

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,700
On Sunday night, she will be put to sleep, and then a fair coin will be flipped.

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,740
If that coin comes up heads, she'll be awakened on Monday and then put back to sleep.

9
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:44,080
If the coin comes up tails, she will also be awakened on Monday and put back to sleep,

10
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,540
but then she will be awakened on Tuesday as well and then put back to sleep.

11
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,680
Now, each time she gets put back to sleep, she will forget that she was ever awakened.

12
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,560
In the brief period, anytime she's awake, she will be told no information,

13
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,160
but she'll be asked one question.

14
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:05,760
What do you believe is the probability that the coin came up heads?

15
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,760
So how should she answer?

16
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,400
Feel free to pause the video and answer the question for yourself right now.

17
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,540
This was my reaction after hearing the problem for the first time.

18
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,740
I mean, the intuitive answer that pops into my head is clearly 1 in 3.

19
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:27,320
It could be the Monday when it came up heads, or it could be the Monday when it came up tails,

20
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,160
or it could be the Tuesday when it came up tails.

21
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,800
But you know what's really interesting is you just answered that the probability of a coin coming up heads is 1 in 3.

22
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,700
I think a lot of this comes down to what specific question is asked of her.

23
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,400
What is the probability that a fair coin flipped gives heads?

24
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,900
That's 50%.

25
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:49,000
What is the probability that the coin came up heads?

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,580
I would say the answer is a third from her perspective.

27
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:56,580
It's remarkably the same question.

28
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,680
The simple reason why Sleeping Beauty should say the probability of heads is 1 in 3

29
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,280
is because she knows the coin is fair.

30
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,980
Nothing changes between when the coin is flipped and when she wakes up.

31
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:13,560
And she knew for a fact that she would be woken up, and she receives no new information when that happens.

32
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,400
Imagine that instead of flipping the coin after she's asleep,

33
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,300
the experimenters flip the coin first and ask her immediately,

34
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,240
what's the probability that the coin came up heads?

35
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,600
Well, she would certainly say 1 in half.

36
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,480
So why should anything change after she goes to sleep and wakes up?

37
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,680
This is known as the halfer position.

38
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,780
But there is another way to look at it.

39
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,220
Others would argue that something does change when she's awakened.

40
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,780
I mean, it seems like she gets no new information.

41
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,520
There are no calendars.

42
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,860
No one tells her anything, and she knew that she would be woken up.

43
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,600
But she actually learns something important.

44
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,940
She learns that she's gone from existing in a reality where there are two possible states,

45
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,800
the coin came up either heads or tails,

46
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,400
to existing in a reality where there are three possible states,

47
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,640
Monday heads, Monday tails, or Tuesday tails.

48
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,020
And therefore, she should assign equal probability to each of these three outcomes,

49
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,820
where heads only occurred in one.

50
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:15,020
So the probability that the coin came up heads is 1 third.

51
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,160
This is known as the thirder position.

52
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:23,720
Now, I know it seems wrong to suggest that a fair coin should have a 1 third probability of coming up heads,

53
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,000
but that's because the question she's asked is subtly different.

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The implied question is, given you're awake,

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,340
what's the probability that the coin came up heads?

56
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,500
And that is 1 third.

57
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,140
Now, halfers would counter that just because there are three possible outcomes

58
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,580
doesn't mean they are each equally likely.

59
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,520
In the Monty Hall problem, for example,

60
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,580
the contestant ultimately has to choose between two doors.

61
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,320
But it'd be wrong to assign them 50-50 odds.

62
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,700
The prize is actually twice as likely to be behind one door than the other.

63
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,160
In the Sleeping Beauty problem,

64
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,860
we know a heads outcome and a tails outcome are equally likely,

65
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,240
so the chance of waking up on Monday with heads is 50%,

66
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:06,200
and the chance of waking up on Monday or Tuesday with tails should be 50%.

67
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,780
Therefore, the tails probability gets split across two days, 25% each.

68
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,080
But if you repeat the experiment over and over,

69
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,280
which you can try for yourself by repeatedly flipping a coin,

70
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,560
you find she wakes up a third of the time Monday heads,

71
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,480
a third of the time Monday tails,

72
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,020
and a third of the time Tuesday tails,

73
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:30,360
not 50-25-25 like the previous analysis would suggest.

74
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,200
So if you were Sleeping Beauty and you were awakened and asked,

75
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,700
what's the probability the coin came up heads?

76
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,440
What would you say?

77
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,000
If you would say 1 third, then hit the like button.

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,380
If you would say 1 half, hit the dislike button.

79
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,880
The answer may seem obvious to you,

80
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:52,520
but you should know that to other people, the other answer seems equally obvious.

81
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,680
And that's why hundreds and hundreds of philosophy papers

82
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,760
have been published on this problem over the past 22 years.

83
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,660
There have been many variations of this problem,

84
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,100
like what if instead of being woken up twice if the coin lands tails,

85
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,940
she's instead woken up a million times?

86
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,540
If the coin comes up heads, she's still woken only once.

87
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,640
Doesn't it seem absurd in this case when Sleeping Beauty wakes up

88
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,720
to say that it was just as likely that the coin landed heads as tails,

89
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,180
when we know there are a million more wakeups in the tails case

90
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,720
than in the heads case?

91
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,060
I mean, if you reach into a bag of one white marble and a million black marbles,

92
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,700
what are the chances that you pull out that one white marble?

93
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:36,700
I was pretty convinced by this, and I considered myself a thirder,

94
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,600
but this same argument is used to convince people

95
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
that we're living in a simulation.

96
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,140
The thinking goes that our computing technology has improved so dramatically,

97
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,540
even over just the last 40 years,

98
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,520
that we can imagine a time in the not-too-distant future

99
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,820
when we can create a completely realistic simulation of our world.

100
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,360
And once that occurs,

101
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,420
it should be trivial to make unlimited copies of that simulation.

102
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,060
And then if you were to ask someone if they're living in a simulation,

103
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,400
they would have to admit that they probably are,

104
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,060
because there are many more instances of that existence

105
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,400
than the one true external reality.

106
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,540
But how do we know that this hasn't happened already,

107
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,940
and that we're living inside a simulation?

108
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,140
I mean, if it can happen, then it probably has happened,

109
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,080
and we are living in a simulation.

110
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,220
This seems like the logical conclusion of the thirder worldview.

111
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,060
Now, I personally don't buy that I'm living in a simulation,

112
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,060
and I think most people don't buy it,

113
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,480
but maybe that's just a logical bias.

114
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,760
But there's another thought experiment

115
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,200
that makes me seriously reconsider the thirder position.

116
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,140
Let's say there's a soccer game between a really great team like Brazil

117
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,940
and a less world-dominating team like Canada.

118
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,140
So the odds are 80-20 in Brazil's favor.

119
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,740
Now, a researcher is going to put you to sleep before the game starts.

120
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,980
And if Brazil wins, they'll wake you up one time.

121
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,820
But if Canada wins, they'll wake you up 30 times in a row.

122
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,360
And just like Sleeping Beauty,

123
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,880
you won't remember if you've been woken before.

124
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,020
Okay, so the game is about to start.

125
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,660
You fall asleep.

126
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,620
And now you're woken up.

127
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,060
Who do you think won the game?

128
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,800
The thirder would say Canada,

129
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,000
but I would almost certainly say Brazil.

130
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,800
I mean, why should I give any weight

131
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,900
to what the researcher would have done if Canada had won

132
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,680
when I'm fairly confident that they won't?

133
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,540
To extend this, let's say Brazil plays Canada five times,

134
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,220
and we do this experiment each time.

135
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,880
Well, then if you say Brazil each time you're woken up,

136
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,880
you'll probably be right about four out of five of the games.

137
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,560
But if you said Canada every time,

138
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,820
you would be wrong about those four games,

139
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,820
but right 30 times in a row

140
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:46,320
when you're repeatedly asked about Canada's one victory.

141
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,660
If you stand to win a bet

142
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,400
by correctly answering the question,

143
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,960
then by all means, you should bet on Canada.

144
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,300
But if you want to correctly pick the winner

145
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,580
of more of the games, well, then you should say Brazil.

146
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,300
And this is what's at the heart of the dispute

147
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,380
between halfers and thirders in the Sleeping Beauty problem.

148
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,480
If you want to be right about the outcome

149
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,840
of the coin tosses,

150
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,880
well, you should say the probability of heads is a half.

151
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,780
But if you want to answer more questionings correctly,

152
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,420
well, then you should say one third.

153
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,500
I want to leave you with one last thought experiment.

154
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,220
Imagine that you know for a fact

155
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,460
that before our universe began, there was a coin flip.

156
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,800
And if it came up heads,

157
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,560
only a single universe would be created.

158
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,860
But if it came up tails,

159
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,940
a quasi-infinite multiverse would be created.

160
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,880
And in each of those multiverse universes,

161
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,080
you'd find every possible variation of Earth

162
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,340
and the people on it.

163
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,780
In some versions, there would be no Earth.

164
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,860
Now, you becoming conscious

165
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,360
is just like Sleeping Beauty waking up.

166
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,160
There's no way to tell if you're in that single universe

167
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,460
or in one of the multiverse universes,

168
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,720
but you know there are a lot more of them.

169
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,500
So would you think that you're for sure in the multiverse

170
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,200
or are the chances 50-50?

171
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,200
The best way to develop intuition about probability

172
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,740
is by working through scenarios or running simulations

173
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,540
like we did for Sleeping Beauty.

174
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,180
This video's sponsor, Brilliant,

175
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,240
offers probability courses that walk you through

176
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,080
lots of situational probability questions.

177
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,760
Do you want to learn how to build your own simulations?

178
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,020
Go check out Brilliant.

179
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,860
You can try it free for 30 days

at brilliant.org slash Veritasium.

181
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,920
You know, to me, Brilliant is the best way to learn

182
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,700
because it forces you to think critically.

183
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,300
And it's also a lot of fun.

184
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,800
I mean, I find learning new things

185
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,460
and sharpening my thinking energizing.

186
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,080
In their lessons, you model the real world with math

187
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,580
and expand your understanding of cutting edge topics

188
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,500
like AI and machine learning,

189
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,940
technology that's transforming our world right now.

190
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,180
Are we actually living in a computer simulation

191
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,740
or a multiverse?

192
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,680
Who knows?

193
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,880
But with Brilliant, you might actually get started

194
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,780
on your journey to figuring it out.

195
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,660
They already have thousands of lessons

196
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,860
and new ones are added every month.

197
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,860
