0	4760	The safest way to reopen the economy soon without causing a second wave in the virus
4760	8120	will involve some notion of contact tracing.
8120	12100	But there's a common misconception that this requires tracking people's locations.
12100	16640	A friend of mine, Nikki Case, recently wrote up a post explaining why contact tracing is
16640	21280	needed and, importantly, how the privacy-protecting variants of it work.
21280	25980	This was done in collaboration with the epidemiologist Marcel Salath√© and the security researcher
25980	27680	Carmela Trencoso.
27680	34760	What follows is a video adaptation of that post.
34760	38520	As far as COVID-19 cares, there are only three kinds of people.
38520	43840	Not infected yet, infected and contagious but with no symptoms, and infected, contagious,
43840	45620	and showing symptoms.
45620	50000	If you have widespread testing, you can get people to self-isolate as soon as they show
50000	51000	symptoms.
51000	54760	The problem is that the virus still spreads because of all the contacts that happened
54760	57680	while people are contagious but asymptomatic.
57680	62960	However, if when someone shows symptoms and tests positive, you isolate not only them
62960	67760	but everyone they've been in contact with, you're staying one step ahead of the virus.
67760	73040	The old-school way to do this is with interviews, but that's slow, it's inefficient, and
73040	76360	frankly it's quite the intrusion on people's privacy.
76360	79600	Another approach in the modern world would be to ask people who've tested positive
79600	84020	to forfeit all the geolocation information from their phones and then to track down the
84020	86700	people who have been in those same spots.
86700	92080	But now we're well into Big Brother territory, so do we have to sacrifice privacy for health?
92080	96120	I'll just let Niki's illustration speak for itself here.
96120	100060	There are several clever algorithms that let you alert everyone who's recently been in
100060	105020	contact with someone who tests positive for COVID-19, but without compromising the privacy
105020	107280	of anyone involved.
107280	110040	Side note here, I found this very surprising.
110040	113480	I know it shouldn't have been since I've gone through this dance many times of thinking
113480	118320	something's impossible only to see that cryptography makes it actually possible, but I wouldn't
118320	122880	blame anyone at all for assuming that downloading an app that can alert everyone you've been
122880	128320	in contact with must necessarily be tracking and revealing your location and a lot of other
128320	129800	information.
129800	134400	The code for these apps is entirely open, so you don't have to trust me or whoever
134400	139680	wrote the app or Niki or anyone to believe it's doing what it really claims to be doing.
139680	141880	Anyway, back to the post.
141880	146000	Let's see how this works with the help of Alice and Bob.
146000	147700	Alice gets a tracing app.
147700	152080	Every 5 minutes, her phone sends out some uniquely pseudorandom gibberish to all the
152080	155340	nearby devices, using Bluetooth.
155340	160200	Because these messages are pseudorandom, they don't use GPS, and they contain no information
160200	163740	about Alice's identity, not her location, not anything.
163740	168680	It really is gibberish, but the key point is that this gibberish is unique.
168680	173800	Now while her phone sends out messages, it also listens for messages from nearby phones.
173800	175720	For example, Bob's.
175720	181960	Bob also has a privacy-first tracing app that's compatible with, or the same, as Alice's.
181960	186160	If Alice and Bob stay close to each other for more than 5 minutes, their phones will
186160	189440	exchange respective strings of unique gibberish.
189440	195720	Both of these phones remember all of the messages they said and heard over the last 14 days.
195720	200760	Again, because the random messages contain no information, Alice's privacy is protected
200760	204120	from Bob, and vice versa.
204120	208120	The next day, Alice develops a dry cough and a fever.
208120	209520	Alice gets tested.
209520	210520	Alice has COVID-19.
210520	213180	This is not a good day for Alice.
213180	215160	But she won't suffer in vain.
215160	219560	Alice tells her app to upload all of the random gibberish messages that it's been sending
219560	222440	out to a hospital database.
222440	225960	To do this, she uses a one-time passcode given to her by her doctor.
225960	228200	This code is to prevent spam.
228200	233960	The database then stores Alice's gibberish, and again, the random messages give no information
233960	238580	about Alice, where she was, who she was with, what she was doing, or even how many people
238580	239720	Alice met.
239720	242060	It really is meaningless to the hospital.
242060	244560	But it's not meaningless to Bob's phone.
244560	248720	Bob's phone often checks this hospital list of random messages that have come in from
248720	250880	COVID-19 positive cases.
250880	255360	Essentially, the hospital's database is saying to all the phones out there, hey, we
255360	257360	just got this new random gibberish.
257360	262480	If you've seen that same random gibberish sometime in the last 14 days, it means you've
262480	267120	been in contact with someone who just tested positive for COVID-19.
267120	270800	Once Bob's phone recognizes some of these numbers that are the gibberish snippets now
270800	276640	known to be associated with positive test cases, it can warn Bob to self-quarantine.
276640	281640	So Bob cuts off the chain of transmissions, we're staying one step ahead of the virus.
281640	282640	And that's it!
282640	287760	That's how digital contact tracing apps can proactively prevent the spread of COVID-19
287760	290000	while also protecting our rights.
290000	291280	Thanks Alice and Bob.
291280	298760	Stay safe.
298760	303040	One important thing to realize is that you don't need everyone to have these apps.
303040	307180	Estimates have it that about 60% would do the trick for COVID-19.
307180	311520	Even if you can't catch all possible contacts, what you need is to catch enough so that the
311520	316820	spread of coronavirus shifts from growing exponentially to shrinking exponentially.
316820	322460	For those of you who know what this means, what we need is for r to drop below 1.
322460	326080	The author of the post that this video is an adaptation of is a friend of mine, Nicky
326080	329240	Case, who is a brilliant programmer and artist.
329240	333920	He often makes these interactive explanations of societally important ideas, including a
333920	338880	new one all about what happens next with COVID-19, so I would highly recommend taking a look
338880	341000	at his work if you get the chance.
341000	344880	He kindly made this post public domain, and moreover helped me in putting together this
344880	346360	video.
346360	350680	Any reasonable plan for reopening the economy without causing a second wave in the virus
350680	354960	will include some kind of contact tracing, and given how counterintuitive the privacy
354960	359520	protection here can be, I wanted to do all that I could to help amplify this message.
359520	364120	If you agree, please do share either Nicky's original post or this video adaptation of
364120	365120	it.
365120	368680	And since the time Nicky posted that, Apple and Google have put out press releases about
368680	371800	their own interoperable contact tracing systems.
371800	375720	And I'll tell you, I'm one of those people who aggressively turns off location tracking
375720	381520	as much as I can on my phone, no matter how annoying the apps can be about asking.
381520	386320	But I'm 100% on board with these apps, because it's not tracking your location or anything
386320	387480	like that.
387480	391020	And if you're a nerd like me who wants to dig into cryptography a bit, I would recommend
391020	395580	looking at the white paper and code for the DP3T algorithm, for which I've left links
395580	397500	in the description.
397500	402240	And as a final note, among the many unfortunate consequences of the lockdowns is a spike in
402240	406000	calls to mental health services, like the suicide prevention hotline.
406000	409880	If someone you know is at risk of suicide, give them a call, make sure they're doing
409880	413760	okay, and if you're at risk, take a look at the resources in the description.
413760	416680	And if it's an option, reach out to the people in your life to talk about what you're
416680	439840	going through.
