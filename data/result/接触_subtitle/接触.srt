00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
The safest way to reopen the economy soon without causing a second wave in the virus

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,120
will involve some notion of contact tracing.

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:12,100
But there's a common misconception that this requires tracking people's locations.

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:16,640
A friend of mine, Nikki Case, recently wrote up a post explaining why contact tracing is

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,280
needed and, importantly, how the privacy-protecting variants of it work.

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,980
This was done in collaboration with the epidemiologist Marcel SalathÃ© and the security researcher

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,680
Carmela Trencoso.

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:34,760
What follows is a video adaptation of that post.

9
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,520
As far as COVID-19 cares, there are only three kinds of people.

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,840
Not infected yet, infected and contagious but with no symptoms, and infected, contagious,

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,620
and showing symptoms.

12
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:50,000
If you have widespread testing, you can get people to self-isolate as soon as they show

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
symptoms.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,760
The problem is that the virus still spreads because of all the contacts that happened

15
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,680
while people are contagious but asymptomatic.

16
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,960
However, if when someone shows symptoms and tests positive, you isolate not only them

17
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,760
but everyone they've been in contact with, you're staying one step ahead of the virus.

18
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,040
The old-school way to do this is with interviews, but that's slow, it's inefficient, and

19
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,360
frankly it's quite the intrusion on people's privacy.

20
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,600
Another approach in the modern world would be to ask people who've tested positive

21
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,020
to forfeit all the geolocation information from their phones and then to track down the

22
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,700
people who have been in those same spots.

23
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,080
But now we're well into Big Brother territory, so do we have to sacrifice privacy for health?

24
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,120
I'll just let Niki's illustration speak for itself here.

25
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,060
There are several clever algorithms that let you alert everyone who's recently been in

26
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:45,020
contact with someone who tests positive for COVID-19, but without compromising the privacy

27
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,280
of anyone involved.

28
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,040
Side note here, I found this very surprising.

29
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,480
I know it shouldn't have been since I've gone through this dance many times of thinking

30
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,320
something's impossible only to see that cryptography makes it actually possible, but I wouldn't

31
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,880
blame anyone at all for assuming that downloading an app that can alert everyone you've been

32
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,320
in contact with must necessarily be tracking and revealing your location and a lot of other

33
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,800
information.

34
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,400
The code for these apps is entirely open, so you don't have to trust me or whoever

35
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,680
wrote the app or Niki or anyone to believe it's doing what it really claims to be doing.

36
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,880
Anyway, back to the post.

37
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,000
Let's see how this works with the help of Alice and Bob.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,700
Alice gets a tracing app.

39
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:32,080
Every 5 minutes, her phone sends out some uniquely pseudorandom gibberish to all the

40
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,340
nearby devices, using Bluetooth.

41
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:40,200
Because these messages are pseudorandom, they don't use GPS, and they contain no information

42
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,740
about Alice's identity, not her location, not anything.

43
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:48,680
It really is gibberish, but the key point is that this gibberish is unique.

44
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,800
Now while her phone sends out messages, it also listens for messages from nearby phones.

45
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,720
For example, Bob's.

46
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:01,960
Bob also has a privacy-first tracing app that's compatible with, or the same, as Alice's.

47
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,160
If Alice and Bob stay close to each other for more than 5 minutes, their phones will

48
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,440
exchange respective strings of unique gibberish.

49
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,720
Both of these phones remember all of the messages they said and heard over the last 14 days.

50
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,760
Again, because the random messages contain no information, Alice's privacy is protected

51
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,120
from Bob, and vice versa.

52
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,120
The next day, Alice develops a dry cough and a fever.

53
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,520
Alice gets tested.

54
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,520
Alice has COVID-19.

55
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,180
This is not a good day for Alice.

56
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,160
But she won't suffer in vain.

57
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,560
Alice tells her app to upload all of the random gibberish messages that it's been sending

58
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,440
out to a hospital database.

59
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,960
To do this, she uses a one-time passcode given to her by her doctor.

60
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,200
This code is to prevent spam.

61
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:53,960
The database then stores Alice's gibberish, and again, the random messages give no information

62
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:58,580
about Alice, where she was, who she was with, what she was doing, or even how many people

63
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,720
Alice met.

64
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,060
It really is meaningless to the hospital.

65
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,560
But it's not meaningless to Bob's phone.

66
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,720
Bob's phone often checks this hospital list of random messages that have come in from

67
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,880
COVID-19 positive cases.

68
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,360
Essentially, the hospital's database is saying to all the phones out there, hey, we

69
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,360
just got this new random gibberish.

70
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:22,480
If you've seen that same random gibberish sometime in the last 14 days, it means you've

71
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,120
been in contact with someone who just tested positive for COVID-19.

72
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,800
Once Bob's phone recognizes some of these numbers that are the gibberish snippets now

73
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,640
known to be associated with positive test cases, it can warn Bob to self-quarantine.

74
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:41,640
So Bob cuts off the chain of transmissions, we're staying one step ahead of the virus.

75
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,640
And that's it!

76
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,760
That's how digital contact tracing apps can proactively prevent the spread of COVID-19

77
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,000
while also protecting our rights.

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,280
Thanks Alice and Bob.

79
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:58,760
Stay safe.

80
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:03,040
One important thing to realize is that you don't need everyone to have these apps.

81
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,180
Estimates have it that about 60% would do the trick for COVID-19.

82
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:11,520
Even if you can't catch all possible contacts, what you need is to catch enough so that the

83
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,820
spread of coronavirus shifts from growing exponentially to shrinking exponentially.

84
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:22,460
For those of you who know what this means, what we need is for r to drop below 1.

85
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,080
The author of the post that this video is an adaptation of is a friend of mine, Nicky

86
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,240
Case, who is a brilliant programmer and artist.

87
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,920
He often makes these interactive explanations of societally important ideas, including a

88
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,880
new one all about what happens next with COVID-19, so I would highly recommend taking a look

89
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,000
at his work if you get the chance.

90
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,880
He kindly made this post public domain, and moreover helped me in putting together this

91
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,360
video.

92
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,680
Any reasonable plan for reopening the economy without causing a second wave in the virus

93
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,960
will include some kind of contact tracing, and given how counterintuitive the privacy

94
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,520
protection here can be, I wanted to do all that I could to help amplify this message.

95
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,120
If you agree, please do share either Nicky's original post or this video adaptation of

96
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,120
it.

97
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,680
And since the time Nicky posted that, Apple and Google have put out press releases about

98
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,800
their own interoperable contact tracing systems.

99
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,720
And I'll tell you, I'm one of those people who aggressively turns off location tracking

100
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:21,520
as much as I can on my phone, no matter how annoying the apps can be about asking.

101
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,320
But I'm 100% on board with these apps, because it's not tracking your location or anything

102
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,480
like that.

103
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:31,020
And if you're a nerd like me who wants to dig into cryptography a bit, I would recommend

104
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,580
looking at the white paper and code for the DP3T algorithm, for which I've left links

105
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,500
in the description.

106
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,240
And as a final note, among the many unfortunate consequences of the lockdowns is a spike in

107
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,000
calls to mental health services, like the suicide prevention hotline.

108
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,880
If someone you know is at risk of suicide, give them a call, make sure they're doing

109
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,760
okay, and if you're at risk, take a look at the resources in the description.

110
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,680
And if it's an option, reach out to the people in your life to talk about what you're

111
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:19,840
going through.
