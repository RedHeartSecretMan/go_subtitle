00:00.000 --> 00:04.760
The safest way to reopen the economy soon without causing a second wave in the virus

00:04.760 --> 00:08.120
will involve some notion of contact tracing.

00:08.120 --> 00:12.100
But there's a common misconception that this requires tracking people's locations.

00:12.100 --> 00:16.640
A friend of mine, Nikki Case, recently wrote up a post explaining why contact tracing is

00:16.640 --> 00:21.280
needed and, importantly, how the privacy-protecting variants of it work.

00:21.280 --> 00:25.980
This was done in collaboration with the epidemiologist Marcel SalathÃ© and the security researcher

00:25.980 --> 00:27.680
Carmela Trencoso.

00:27.680 --> 00:34.760
What follows is a video adaptation of that post.

00:34.760 --> 00:38.520
As far as COVID-19 cares, there are only three kinds of people.

00:38.520 --> 00:43.840
Not infected yet, infected and contagious but with no symptoms, and infected, contagious,

00:43.840 --> 00:45.620
and showing symptoms.

00:45.620 --> 00:50.000
If you have widespread testing, you can get people to self-isolate as soon as they show

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
symptoms.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.760
The problem is that the virus still spreads because of all the contacts that happened

00:54.760 --> 00:57.680
while people are contagious but asymptomatic.

00:57.680 --> 01:02.960
However, if when someone shows symptoms and tests positive, you isolate not only them

01:02.960 --> 01:07.760
but everyone they've been in contact with, you're staying one step ahead of the virus.

01:07.760 --> 01:13.040
The old-school way to do this is with interviews, but that's slow, it's inefficient, and

01:13.040 --> 01:16.360
frankly it's quite the intrusion on people's privacy.

01:16.360 --> 01:19.600
Another approach in the modern world would be to ask people who've tested positive

01:19.600 --> 01:24.020
to forfeit all the geolocation information from their phones and then to track down the

01:24.020 --> 01:26.700
people who have been in those same spots.

01:26.700 --> 01:32.080
But now we're well into Big Brother territory, so do we have to sacrifice privacy for health?

01:32.080 --> 01:36.120
I'll just let Niki's illustration speak for itself here.

01:36.120 --> 01:40.060
There are several clever algorithms that let you alert everyone who's recently been in

01:40.060 --> 01:45.020
contact with someone who tests positive for COVID-19, but without compromising the privacy

01:45.020 --> 01:47.280
of anyone involved.

01:47.280 --> 01:50.040
Side note here, I found this very surprising.

01:50.040 --> 01:53.480
I know it shouldn't have been since I've gone through this dance many times of thinking

01:53.480 --> 01:58.320
something's impossible only to see that cryptography makes it actually possible, but I wouldn't

01:58.320 --> 02:02.880
blame anyone at all for assuming that downloading an app that can alert everyone you've been

02:02.880 --> 02:08.320
in contact with must necessarily be tracking and revealing your location and a lot of other

02:08.320 --> 02:09.800
information.

02:09.800 --> 02:14.400
The code for these apps is entirely open, so you don't have to trust me or whoever

02:14.400 --> 02:19.680
wrote the app or Niki or anyone to believe it's doing what it really claims to be doing.

02:19.680 --> 02:21.880
Anyway, back to the post.

02:21.880 --> 02:26.000
Let's see how this works with the help of Alice and Bob.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.700
Alice gets a tracing app.

02:27.700 --> 02:32.080
Every 5 minutes, her phone sends out some uniquely pseudorandom gibberish to all the

02:32.080 --> 02:35.340
nearby devices, using Bluetooth.

02:35.340 --> 02:40.200
Because these messages are pseudorandom, they don't use GPS, and they contain no information

02:40.200 --> 02:43.740
about Alice's identity, not her location, not anything.

02:43.740 --> 02:48.680
It really is gibberish, but the key point is that this gibberish is unique.

02:48.680 --> 02:53.800
Now while her phone sends out messages, it also listens for messages from nearby phones.

02:53.800 --> 02:55.720
For example, Bob's.

02:55.720 --> 03:01.960
Bob also has a privacy-first tracing app that's compatible with, or the same, as Alice's.

03:01.960 --> 03:06.160
If Alice and Bob stay close to each other for more than 5 minutes, their phones will

03:06.160 --> 03:09.440
exchange respective strings of unique gibberish.

03:09.440 --> 03:15.720
Both of these phones remember all of the messages they said and heard over the last 14 days.

03:15.720 --> 03:20.760
Again, because the random messages contain no information, Alice's privacy is protected

03:20.760 --> 03:24.120
from Bob, and vice versa.

03:24.120 --> 03:28.120
The next day, Alice develops a dry cough and a fever.

03:28.120 --> 03:29.520
Alice gets tested.

03:29.520 --> 03:30.520
Alice has COVID-19.

03:30.520 --> 03:33.180
This is not a good day for Alice.

03:33.180 --> 03:35.160
But she won't suffer in vain.

03:35.160 --> 03:39.560
Alice tells her app to upload all of the random gibberish messages that it's been sending

03:39.560 --> 03:42.440
out to a hospital database.

03:42.440 --> 03:45.960
To do this, she uses a one-time passcode given to her by her doctor.

03:45.960 --> 03:48.200
This code is to prevent spam.

03:48.200 --> 03:53.960
The database then stores Alice's gibberish, and again, the random messages give no information

03:53.960 --> 03:58.580
about Alice, where she was, who she was with, what she was doing, or even how many people

03:58.580 --> 03:59.720
Alice met.

03:59.720 --> 04:02.060
It really is meaningless to the hospital.

04:02.060 --> 04:04.560
But it's not meaningless to Bob's phone.

04:04.560 --> 04:08.720
Bob's phone often checks this hospital list of random messages that have come in from

04:08.720 --> 04:10.880
COVID-19 positive cases.

04:10.880 --> 04:15.360
Essentially, the hospital's database is saying to all the phones out there, hey, we

04:15.360 --> 04:17.360
just got this new random gibberish.

04:17.360 --> 04:22.480
If you've seen that same random gibberish sometime in the last 14 days, it means you've

04:22.480 --> 04:27.120
been in contact with someone who just tested positive for COVID-19.

04:27.120 --> 04:30.800
Once Bob's phone recognizes some of these numbers that are the gibberish snippets now

04:30.800 --> 04:36.640
known to be associated with positive test cases, it can warn Bob to self-quarantine.

04:36.640 --> 04:41.640
So Bob cuts off the chain of transmissions, we're staying one step ahead of the virus.

04:41.640 --> 04:42.640
And that's it!

04:42.640 --> 04:47.760
That's how digital contact tracing apps can proactively prevent the spread of COVID-19

04:47.760 --> 04:50.000
while also protecting our rights.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.280
Thanks Alice and Bob.

04:51.280 --> 04:58.760
Stay safe.

04:58.760 --> 05:03.040
One important thing to realize is that you don't need everyone to have these apps.

05:03.040 --> 05:07.180
Estimates have it that about 60% would do the trick for COVID-19.

05:07.180 --> 05:11.520
Even if you can't catch all possible contacts, what you need is to catch enough so that the

05:11.520 --> 05:16.820
spread of coronavirus shifts from growing exponentially to shrinking exponentially.

05:16.820 --> 05:22.460
For those of you who know what this means, what we need is for r to drop below 1.

05:22.460 --> 05:26.080
The author of the post that this video is an adaptation of is a friend of mine, Nicky

05:26.080 --> 05:29.240
Case, who is a brilliant programmer and artist.

05:29.240 --> 05:33.920
He often makes these interactive explanations of societally important ideas, including a

05:33.920 --> 05:38.880
new one all about what happens next with COVID-19, so I would highly recommend taking a look

05:38.880 --> 05:41.000
at his work if you get the chance.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.880
He kindly made this post public domain, and moreover helped me in putting together this

05:44.880 --> 05:46.360
video.

05:46.360 --> 05:50.680
Any reasonable plan for reopening the economy without causing a second wave in the virus

05:50.680 --> 05:54.960
will include some kind of contact tracing, and given how counterintuitive the privacy

05:54.960 --> 05:59.520
protection here can be, I wanted to do all that I could to help amplify this message.

05:59.520 --> 06:04.120
If you agree, please do share either Nicky's original post or this video adaptation of

06:04.120 --> 06:05.120
it.

06:05.120 --> 06:08.680
And since the time Nicky posted that, Apple and Google have put out press releases about

06:08.680 --> 06:11.800
their own interoperable contact tracing systems.

06:11.800 --> 06:15.720
And I'll tell you, I'm one of those people who aggressively turns off location tracking

06:15.720 --> 06:21.520
as much as I can on my phone, no matter how annoying the apps can be about asking.

06:21.520 --> 06:26.320
But I'm 100% on board with these apps, because it's not tracking your location or anything

06:26.320 --> 06:27.480
like that.

06:27.480 --> 06:31.020
And if you're a nerd like me who wants to dig into cryptography a bit, I would recommend

06:31.020 --> 06:35.580
looking at the white paper and code for the DP3T algorithm, for which I've left links

06:35.580 --> 06:37.500
in the description.

06:37.500 --> 06:42.240
And as a final note, among the many unfortunate consequences of the lockdowns is a spike in

06:42.240 --> 06:46.000
calls to mental health services, like the suicide prevention hotline.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.880
If someone you know is at risk of suicide, give them a call, make sure they're doing

06:49.880 --> 06:53.760
okay, and if you're at risk, take a look at the resources in the description.

06:53.760 --> 06:56.680
And if it's an option, reach out to the people in your life to talk about what you're

06:56.680 --> 07:19.840
going through.
